#Description
Do not allow users to remember multi-factor authentication on devices.

Remembering Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for devices and browsers allows users to have the option to bypass MFA
for a set number of days after performing a successful sign-in using MFA. This can enhance usability by minimizing the number of times
a user may need to perform two-step verification on the same device. However, if an account or device is compromised, 
remembering MFA for trusted devices may affect security. Hence, it is recommended that users not be allowed to bypass MFA.

#Impact Statement
For every login attempt, the user will be required to perform multi-factor authentication.
