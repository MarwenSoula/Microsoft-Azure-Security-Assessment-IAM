#Description

For designated users, they will be prompted to use their multi-factor authentication (MFA) process on logins.

Enabling multi-factor authentication is a recommended setting to limit the potential of accounts being compromised and limiting access to authenticated personnel.

#Impact Statement

There is an increased cost, as Conditional Access policies require Azure AD Premium. Similarly, this may require additional overhead to maintain if users lose access to their MFA.
