#Description

Ensure that all administrators are notified if any other administrator resets their password.

Administrator accounts are sensitive. Any password reset activity notification, 
when sent to all administrators, ensures that all administrators can passively confirm if such a reset is a common pattern within their group. 
For example, if all administrators change their password every 30 days, any password reset activity before that may require administrator(s) 
to evaluate any unusual activity and confirm its origin.

#Impact Statement
All other Admins will receive a notification from Azure every time a password is reset. This is useful for auditing procedures to confirm that there are no out of the ordinary password resets for Admins. There is additional overhead, however, in the time required for Admins to audit the notifications. This setting is only useful if all Admins pay attention to the notifications, and audit each one.

#Audit Procedure
From Azure Portal

From Azure Home select the Portal Menu
Select Azure Active Directory
Then Users
Select Password reset
Then Notification
Ensure that notify all admins when other admins reset their password? is set to Yes

#Remediation Procedure
From Azure Portal

From Azure Home select the Portal Menu
Select Azure Active Directory
Then Users
Select Password reset
Then Notification
Set Notify all admins when other admins reset their password? to Yes
