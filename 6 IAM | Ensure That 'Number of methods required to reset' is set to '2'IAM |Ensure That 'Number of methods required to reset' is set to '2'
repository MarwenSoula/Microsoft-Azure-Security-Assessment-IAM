#Description

Ensures that two alternate forms of identification are provided before allowing a password reset.

A Self-service Password Reset (SSPR) through Azure Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) ensures the user's identity is confirmed 
using two separate methods of identification. With multiple methods set, an attacker would have to compromise both methods 
before they could maliciously reset a user's password.

#Impact Statement

There may be administrative overhead, as users who lose access to their secondary authentication methods will need an administrator 
with permissions to remove it. There will also need to be organization-wide security policies and training to teach administrators 
to verify the identity of the requesting user so that social engineering can not render this setting useless.

#Audit Procedure
From Azure Portal

From Azure Home select the Portal Menu
Select Azure Active Directory
Then Users
Select Password reset
Then Authentication methods
Ensure that Number of methods required to reset is set to 2


#Remediation Procedure
From Azure Portal

From Azure Home select the Portal Menu
Select Azure Active Directory
Then Users
Select Password reset
Then Authentication methods
