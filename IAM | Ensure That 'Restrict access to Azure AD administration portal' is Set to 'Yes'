#Description
Restrict access to the Azure AD administration portal to administrators only.

This only affects access to the Azure AD administrator's web portal. 
This setting does not prohibit privileged users from using other methods such as Rest API or Powershell to obtain sensitive information from Azure AD.

The Azure AD administrative portal has sensitive data and permission settings. 
All non-administrators should be prohibited from accessing any Azure AD data in the administration portal to avoid exposure.

#Impact Statement
All administrative tasks will need to be done by Administrators, causing additional overhead in management of users and resources.
