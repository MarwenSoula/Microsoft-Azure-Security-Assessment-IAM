#Description
Microsoft Azure creates a default bad password policy that is already applied to Azure administrative and normal user accounts. 
This is not applied to user accounts that are synced from an on-premise Active Directory unless Azure AD Connect is used and you enable 
EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers. Please see the list in default values on the specifics of this policy.

Enabling this gives your organization further customization on what secure passwords are allowed. 
Setting a bad password list enables your organization to fine-tune its password policy further, depending on your needs. 
Removing easy-to-guess passwords increases the security of access to your Azure resources.

#Impact Statement
Increasing needed password complexity might increase overhead on administration of user accounts.
