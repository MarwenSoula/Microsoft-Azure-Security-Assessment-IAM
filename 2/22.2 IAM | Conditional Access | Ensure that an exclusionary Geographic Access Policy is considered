#Description

If these policies are created without first auditing and testing the result, 
misconfiguration can potentially lock out administrators or create undesired access issues.

Conditional Access Policies can be used to block access from geographic locations that are deemed out-of-scope for your organization or application. 
The scope and variables for this policy should be carefully examined and defined.

#Rationale Statement
Conditional Access, when used as a deny list for the tenant or subscription, 
is able to prevent ingress or egress of traffic to countries that are outside of the scope of interest (customers, suppliers) or jurisdiction of an organization. 
This is an effective way to prevent unnecessary and long-lasting exposure to international threats such as APTs.

Impact Statement
Azure AD Premium is required. Limiting access geographically will deny access to users that are traveling or working remotely in a different part of the world. 
A point-to-site or site to site tunnel such as a VPN is recommended to address exceptions to geographic access policies.
