#Description
Allow users to provide consent for selected permissions when a request is coming from a verified publisher.

Unless Azure Active Directory is running as an identity provider for third-party applications, 
do not allow users to use their identity outside of the cloud environment. User profiles contain private information 
such as phone numbers and email addresses which could then be sold off to other third parties without requiring any further consent from the user.

#Impact Statement
Enforcing this setting may create additional requests that administrators need to fulfill quite often.
