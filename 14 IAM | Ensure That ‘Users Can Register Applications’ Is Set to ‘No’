#Description
Require administrators or appropriately delegated users to register third-party applications.

It is recommended to only allow an administrator to register custom-developed applications. 
This ensures that the application undergoes a formal security review and approval process prior to exposing Azure Active Directory data. 
Certain users like developers or other high-request users may also be delegated permissions to prevent them from waiting on an administrative user. 
Your organization should review your policies and decide your needs.

#Impact Statement
Enforcing this setting will create additional requests for approval that will need to be addressed by an administrator. 
If permissions are delegated, a user may approve a malevolent third party application, potentially giving it access to your data.
