#Description


Azure Active Directory Conditional Access allows an organization to configure Named locations and configure whether those locations are trusted or untrusted. 
These settings provide organizations the means to specify Geographical locations for use in conditional access policies, 
or define actual IP addresses and IP ranges and whether or not those IP addresses and/or ranges are trusted by the organization.
Defining trusted source IP addresses or ranges helps organizations create and enforce Conditional Access policies around those trusted or untrusted IP addresses
and ranges. Users authenticating from trusted IP addresses and/or ranges may have less access restrictions 
or access requirements when compared to users that try to authenticate to Azure Active Directory from untrusted locations or untrusted source IP addresses/ranges.

#Impact Statement

When configuring Named locations, the organization can create locations using Geographical location data or by defining source IP addresses or ranges. 
Configuring Named locations using a Country location does not provide the organization the ability to mark those locations as trusted, 
and any Conditional Access policy relying on those Countries location setting will not be able to use the All trusted locations setting within 
the Conditional Access policy. They instead will have to rely on the Select locations setting. 
This may add additional resource requirements when configuring, and will require thorough organizational testing.

In general, Conditional Access policies may completely prevent users from authenticating to Azure Active Directory, 
and thorough testing is recommended. To avoid complete lockout, a 'Break Glass' account with full Global Administrator rights is recommended
in the event all other administrators are locked out of authenticating to Azure Active Directory. 
This 'Break Glass' account should be excluded from Conditional Access Policies and should be configured with the longest pass phrase feasible. 
This account should only be used in the event of an emergency and complete administrator lockout.

#Audit Procedure
From Azure Portal

In the Azure Portal, navigate to Azure AD Conditional Access
Click on Named locations
Ensure there are IP ranges location settings configured and marked as Trusted


#Remediation Procedure
From Azure Portal

Navigate to the Azure AD Conditional Access Blade
Click on the Named locations blade
Within the Named locations blade, click on IP ranges location
Enter a name for this location setting in the Name text box
Click on the + sign
Add an IP Address Range in CIDR notation inside the text box that appears
Click on the Add button
Repeat steps 5 through 7 for each IP Range that needs to be added
If the information entered are trusted ranges, select the Mark as trusted location check box
Once finished, click on Create
